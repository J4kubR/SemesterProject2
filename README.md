# Semester Project 2
The Project was about developing a brick sorting algorithm for the UR5 robotic arm, with the usage of C++ for the overall GUI and connection between software and hardware, Assembly for the Atmega644 board and 3d printing an usable gripper to mount on the UR5 arm. I was responsible for overseeing the total progress of the project and the whole C++ code.

When opening the assembly file "Gripper_peter_done.iam" in Autodesk Inventor. Just press "skip All" when prompted for "missing parts".

Demo video of the robot program in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvQ3HG4hXTY

The C++ code for GUI and connection is in the C++ code folder: all the files are there with a makefile which can run it correctly

In the Assembly code folder there is a assembly code which can be opened

There are comments in the both of the codes, so that it will be easier to understand, most important the assembly code and panel.cpp 

Enjoy !
